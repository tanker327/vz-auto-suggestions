# vz-auto-suggestions

I created this javascript file for verizon site search team to show the auto suggestions for the search box in the 
top of each page in the Verizon website.
This file was first released at 01/15/2014. Several updates was made as per new requirements in the next a few months.
Depends on different configs, it works for all version or verizon's website (desktop/mobile/tablet) with part of 
differnt look.

As 01/18/2016, this file is still used in the Mobile/Table version of the website. You can get the file from the 
link http://scache.vzw.com/search/staticContent/dist/js/autosuggest.js or check the source code of Verizon mobile website
(make sure you will use mobile simulator or user agent). This file is not used in the desktop version of Verizon website.

I am not trying to disclose the source code I created for verizon. The current site search team put this file 
to public without minified (not sure why), and  everyone can see this file directly from Verizon's website. I believe
it is fine for me to save a copy of my preview work here. 

Please let me know if anyone believe it is not proper to have a copy here, I will remove it. 

Also, keep in mind this is the work I did at beginning of 2014. Now I can make this kind things way better even.

Thanks!
Eric
